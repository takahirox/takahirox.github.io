      Hi, I am Takahiro. I am originally from Japan and based on California, the USA now.
	  I am a Software enginner at Mozilla. Working with
      <a href="https://www.khronos.org/gltf/">glTF</a> /
      <a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/">WebGL</a> /
      <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/">WebGPU</a> /
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/">WebXR</a> and
      on <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/">Hubs</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very passionate about technology. I really like solving complex technical problems.
      I like working with talented people. I like sharing my ideas with them and learning
      from each other. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am really excited to work for Web 3D because they are
      very hot and new challenging technologies. I like working on Web 3D library because
      it has a lot of opportunities. Web 3D is growing since WebGL launched because of
      the evolution from 2D Web contents to 3D, its portability, easiness to see,
      easiness to make, easiness to collaborate. And now it's extending Web to the new world,
      WebXR. Library/Framework is a center core of Web 3D. Working on it has a huge impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Mozilla, I have been working on WebXR content creation helper tools to improve WebXR 
      developers' productivity by allowing the test of WebXR application in their desktop
      browsers without the need of WebXR devices. And I am in Hubs, Mozilla's Web-based open
      and global virtual collaboration platform, team and have been working for Automatic
      performance test, Audio experience improvement, and WebGL stuff optimizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also like Low-level. Before I joined Mozilla, I worked on Oracle in-memory database
      chip-level tuning project in Fujistu with Oracle database team. I led the Fujitsu
      platform project of it with C/C++ and SIMD, and achieved 100x better performance
      compared to the traditional databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that, I worked as a hardware engineer and designed server processor. I obtained
      five patents to tackle challenging problems then.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time I studied UNIX kernel and published a UNIX text used in multiple college
      courses. Recently I wrote RISC-V, open ISA, processor and peripheral device emulator
      in Rust + WebAssembly that users can run/debug Linux on it in their desktop browsers.
      It is good for RISC-V learners.
    </p>
