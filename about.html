    <p>
      Hi, I am Takahiro. I am a full-stack Software engineer, previously at Mozilla. I like
      working for and with Web standards(<a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/">WebGL</a>,
      <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/">WebGPU</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/">WebXR</a>),
      Web browsers(<a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/">Chromium</a>),
      and 3D model standard file formats(<a href="https://www.khronos.org/gltf/">glTF</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very passionate about technology. I really like solving complex technical problems.
      I like working with talented people. I like sharing my ideas with them and learning
      from each other. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am committed to contributing to web standards and web browsers. Web browsers are the
      foundation for a wide range of applications, and they are essential to systems around
      the world. Therefore, contributing to web standards and web browsers has the potential
      to have a positive impact on the world, and I am eager to be a part of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am particularly interested in WebGPU. The new low-level graphics API will make 3D
      rendering even faster and further expand the possibilities of using 3D in browsers.
      In addition, the GPU computing function can also be used to accelerate AI processing,
      which has been attracting attention in recent years. I would like to be involved in
      promoting WebGPU, which has great potential, and I am contributing to the
      specifications and browser implementations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also find it rewarding to create debuggers and support tools. Learning new web
      standards can be a challenge for end users. Debuggers and support tools can help
      them learn the new technologies. With this in mind, I created a WebGPU debugger browser
      extension and an online WGSL editor, WGSL is a new shading language introduced for
      WebGPU.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also enjoy contributing to libraries. Sometimes, web standards are too complex for
      end-users to handle directly. Libraries that hide complexity and make it easier to use
      are essential to the adoption of web standards. From this belief, I have been contributing
      to Three.js, the most popular JavaScript 3D graphics library using WebGL, as a core member.
      I believe that such contributions to support tools and libraries are helping to promote
      the adoption of web standards and enhance the possibilities of the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Mozilla, I worked on WebXR content creation helper tools to improve WebXR 
      developers' productivity by allowing the test of WebXR application in their desktop
      browsers without the need of WebXR devices. And I was in Hubs, Mozilla's Web-based open
      and global virtual collaboration platform, team and worked for ECS architecture
      migration, performance optimization, better Mac/Android/iOS support, contribution
      to Three.js on which Hubs is built, documenting, and backend with Elixir.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also like Low-level. Before I joined Mozilla, I worked on Oracle in-memory database
      chip-level tuning project in Fujistu with Oracle database team. I led the Fujitsu
      platform specific Oracle In-memory Database library project with C/C++ and SIMD, and achieved
      100x better performance compared to the traditional databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that, I worked as a hardware engineer and designed server processor. I obtained
      five patents to tackle challenging problems then.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time I studied UNIX kernel and published a UNIX kernel text book used in
      multiple college courses. Recently I wrote RISC-V, open ISA, processor and peripheral
      device emulator in Rust + WebAssembly that users can run/debug Linux on it in their
      desktop browsers. It is good for RISC-V learners.
